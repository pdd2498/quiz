# Quiz Website

This project is a quiz application built with React. It fetches quiz questions from an external API and presents them to the user, keeping track of the user's score and showing the correct answers.


## Demo

You can see a live demo of the application [here](https://incredible-starburst-3c4a83.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Fetches multiple choice questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
- Highlights correct and incorrect answers.
- Tracks the user's score.
- Stores quiz data in local storage to avoid redundant API calls.
- Provides a simple UI with responsive design.

## Usage

The application will display a series of multiple choice questions. Users can click on their chosen answer. Correct answers will be highlighted in green, and incorrect answers will be highlighted in red. After each question, the application waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next question.

If the user reaches the end of the quiz, their score is displayed, and they can start a new game by clicking the "Next Game" button.
